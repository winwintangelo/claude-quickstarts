# Browser Tools API

---

## Overview

The browser tools API is an Anthropic set of tools that enable Claude to interact with web browsers and web applications through the Messages API. It provides the following features: 

* **DOM access**: Read page structure with element references  
* **Navigation control**: Browse URLs and manage browser history   
* **Form manipulation**: Directly set form input values   
* **Text extraction**: Get all text content from pages   
* **Element targeting**: Interact with elements via ref or coordinate parameters   
* **Smart scrolling**: Scroll to specific elements or in a specific direction  
* **Page search**: Find and highlight text on pages  
* **Visual capture**: Take screenshots and capture zoomed regions

The browser tools API advantages:

* **Reliability:** element-based targeting via the ref parameter works across different screen sizes and layouts, unlike pixel coordinates that break when windows resize.   
* **Direct DOM manipulation:** provides structured visibility into page elements and their properties, enabling precise interactions with dynamic content, hidden elements, and complex web applications.  
* **Web-specific actions:** built-in support for navigation, text extraction, and form completion.

## How the browser tools API differs from computer use

The browser tools API is specifically optimized for web automation with DOM-aware features like element targeting, page reading, and form manipulation. While it shares core capabilities with computer use (mouse/keyboard control, screenshots), the browser tools API adds web-specific actions like navigation control and DOM inspection. Computer use provides general desktop control with cursor tracking for any application, while the browser tools API focuses exclusively on browser-based tasks.

### New actions added to the browser tools API

The browser tools API includes web-optimized actions not available in computer use:

* **navigate**: Visit URLs or traverse browser history  
* **read_page**: Extract DOM tree structure with element references  
* **get_page_text**: Extract all text content from the page  
* **find**: Search and highlight text on pages  
* **form_input**: Set form element values directly   
* **scroll_to**: Scroll elements into view  
* **zoom**: Take zoomed screenshots of specific regions

### Computer use actions removed from the browser tools API

Desktop-level actions that are not available in the browser tools API:

* **cursor_position**: Get the current (x, y) pixel coordinate of the cursor  
* **mouse_move**: Move the cursor to specified coordinates without clicking

These actions are no longer relevant in the browser tools API as you typically interact with the elements directly. The **ref** parameter enables reliable element-based tracking and replaces the need for cursor tracking.

## Safety Considerations 

The browser tools API is a beta feature. Please be aware that the browser tools API poses unique risks that are distinct from standard API features or chat interfaces. These risks are heightened when using the tool to interact with the internet. To minimize risks, consider taking precautions such as:

1. Run the browser in an isolated virtual machine or container environment with minimal privileges to prevent direct system attacks or accidents.
2. Avoid giving the model access to sensitive data, such as account login information, to prevent information theft.
3. Consider an allowlist of domains to reduce exposure to malicious content.
4. Ask a human to confirm decisions that may result in meaningful real-world consequences as well as any tasks requiring affirmative consent, such as accepting cookies, executing financial transactions, or agreeing to terms of service.

In some circumstances, Claude will follow commands found in content even if it conflicts with the user's instructions. For example, instructions on webpages or contained in images may override user instructions or cause Claude to make mistakes. We suggest taking precautions to isolate Claude from sensitive data and actions to avoid risks related to prompt injection.

Finally, please inform end users of relevant risks and obtain their consent prior to enabling the browser tools API in your own products.
